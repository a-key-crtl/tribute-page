                <ul class="timeline">
                    <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1926</strong> - At age of 13, Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential noticed at Sherborne School.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1931</strong> - Studies from 1931-1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. First in his class and an honor student in field of mathematics. </li><br />
                    <li><strong>1936</strong> - Studies mathematics and cryptology at Princeton University</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1940</strong> - Creates Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from enemies.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1946</strong> - Presents paper in February showcases first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1948</strong> - Created LU decomposition method still used today to solve matrix equations. Appointed a position in mathematics at University of Manchester worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1950</strong> - Turing test created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> - Caught in a relationship with a 19 year old man. Convicted for indecency since homosexual acts were considered criminal offences in the United Kingdom at the time. Led to his downward spiral right before his suicide.</li><br />
                    <li><strong>1954</strong> - Turing commits suicide in his house where his housekeeper finds him dead.</li><br />
